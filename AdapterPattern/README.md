# Adapter pattern

The adapter pattern is a structural pattern.

## Intent

- Allows objects with incompatible interfaces to collaborate

## Applicability

- Use the adapter pattern when you want to use some existing class, but its interface isn't compatible
with the rest of the code
- Use the pattern when you want to reuse several existing subclasses that lack some common functionality
that can't be added to the superclass
