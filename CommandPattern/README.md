# Command pattern

## Intent

A behavioural design pattern that turns a request into a stand-alone object that contains all information about the request.
This transformation lets you parameterise methods with different requests, delay or queue a requestâ€™s execution, and support undoable operations.

## Applicability

- Use the Command pattern when you want to parametrize objects with operations.
- Use the Command pattern when you want to queue operations, schedule their execution, or execute them remotely.
- Use the Command pattern when you want to implement reversible operations.
