# Flyweight

## Intent

- Flyweight is a structural pattern that lets you optimise the usage of memory by sharing common parts of state between
multiple objects.

## Applicability

- Use the Flyweight pattern only when your program must support a huge number of objects which barely fit into available RAM.
